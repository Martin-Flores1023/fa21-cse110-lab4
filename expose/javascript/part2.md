1. At line 12 we will print out the amouunt of times 
   the loop iterated --> 3 times.
2. Line 12 will return 150, the discounted price of the last index in our values.
    For example our last value is 300 and we have a discount of 0.5 so we
    expect to get an output of 150.
3. Output is 150, This is the value we should receive after we have 
    applied to the discount to the original price.
4. [50,100,250]
5. ERROR: line 13 does not work because when using the 'let' keyword 
    with 'i' it is outside of its scope when we call it again.
6. ERROR: line 13 does not work because when using the 'let' keyword 
    with 'discountedPrice' it is outside of its scope when we call it again.
7. We get an output of 150 and in this case it works because we are callig
    the variable within its respective scope and dont get an error
    like before.
8. [50,100,250]
9. ERROR: the variable we are trying to access is not defined within the
    scope we are in.
10. We get an output of 3 which is the lenght of our array.
11. [50,100,250]
12. A. console.log(student.name);
    B. console.log(student['Grad Year']);
    C. console.log(student.greeting());
    D. console.log(student['Favorite Teacher'].name);
    E. console.log(student.courseLoad[0]);
13. A. '32'
    B. 1
    C. 3
    D. '3null'
    E. 4
    F. 0
    G. '3undefined'
    H. NaN
14. A. True
    B. False
    C. True
    D. False
    E. False
    F. True
15. Both == and === are used in comparison. The only difference is 
    that == does comparison without checking the datatype. While,
    === does the comparison but checks the datatype and will only
    return true if both the datatype and values are the same.
16. The result will be an array that contains the value of each indeex * 2. 
    For example we pass in array [1,2,3,] and get output of [2,4,6]. KEEP Adding more....
17. Output is 1 4 3 2.
